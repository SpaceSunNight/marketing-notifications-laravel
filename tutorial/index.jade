    ## SMS and MMS Marketing Notifications

    Ready to implement SMS and MMS marketing notifications? Here's how it works
    at a high level:

    1. A user you'd like to reach sends an SMS text message to a Twilio phone
       number you advertise in print, online, or in TV advertising.
    2. Your application confirms that the user wants to receive SMS and MMS
       notifications from your application.
    3. An administrator or marketing campaign manager uses a web form to craft a
       message that will go out to all subscribers via SMS/MMS message.

    ## Building Blocks

    To get this done, you'll be working with the following Twilio APIs:

    * [TwiML](//www.local.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml) and the [<Message>
    Verb](/docs/api/twiml/sms/message): We'll use TwiML to manage interactions
    initiated by the user via SMS.
    * [Messages Resource](/docs/api/rest/sending-sms): We will use the REST API
    to broadcast messages out to all subscribers.

    Let's get started! Click the right arrow to move on to the next step of the

    ## Subscriber

    In order to send out marketing notifications to a subscriber, we need to
    provide the right model.

    * The `phone_number` will allow the application to know where to send the
    notifications.
    * `subscribed` let the application to identify which subscribers are
    active, only an active subscriber will receive notifications.

    ## Handling Incoming messages

    This is the endpoint that will be called every time our application receives
    a message.

    It relies on a `createMessage` method that produces the message that
    will be returned to the sender. It hides the complexity behind creating new
    subscribers.

    ## Creating Subscribers

    We begin by getting the texter's phone number from the incoming [Twilio
    request](/docs/api/twiml/sms/twilio_request). Now, we need to find a
    `Subscriber` model with that phone number.

    If there's no subscriber with this phone number, we create one, save it, and
    respond with a message asking them to text "_subscribe_" to confirm that
    they want to receive messages from us.

    And that's all we want at this step! We've created a `Subscriber` model to
    keep track of the people that want our messages, and saved them in the
    database when they text us for the first time.

.step(
  data-title='Manage Subscriptions',
  data-file='app/Http/Controllers/SubscribersController.php'
  data-highlight='51-71')
  :markdown
    ## Manage Subscriptions

      We want to provide the user with two SMS commands to manage their
      subscription status: `subscribe` and `unsubscribe`.  These commands will
      toggle a boolean flag for their `Subscriber` record in the database, and
      will determine whether or not they receive messages from our marketing
      campaign. Because we're not jerks, we don't opt them in automatically -
      rather, we have them confirm that they want to receive messages from us
      first.

      To make this happen, we will need to update the controller logic which
      handles the incoming text message to do a couple things:

      * If the texter is a person already in the database, parse the message
      they sent to see if it's a command we recognize.
      * If it is a `subscribe` or `unsubscribe` command, update their
      subscription status in the database.
      * If it is a command we don't recognize, send them a message explaining
      available commands.

    ## Sending Notifications

    On the server, we grab the message text and image URL, then loop through all
    Subscribers and call the method `sendMessage` to send the message.

    When the messages are on their way, we redirect back to the
    `notifications.create` route with a [Flash
    Data](//laravel.com/docs/5.0/session#flash-data) message containing feedback
    about the messaging attempt.

    ## Send SMS or MMS Notifications

    Now that we have a list of subscribers for our awesome SMS and MMS content,
    we need to provide our marketing team some kind of interface to send out
    messages.

    When the model object is loaded, it creates a [Twilio REST API
    client](//github.com/twilio/twilio-php) that it can use to send SMS and MMS
    messages. The client requires your Twilio account credentials (an account
    SID and auth token), which can be found [in the account
    portal](/user/account).

    Next all we need to do is call `sendMessage` on the
    `client->account->messages` object in order to send our message. The Twilio
    Message API call requires a '$from' and '$to' parameter, a '$body' and an
    array of '$mediaUrls', the last one is optional.

    ## Where to Next?

    That's it! We've just implemented a an opt-in process and an administrative
    interface to run an SMS and MMS marketing campaign. Now all you need is
    killer content to share with your users via text or MMS.
